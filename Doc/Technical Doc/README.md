For the description of both the DPSNN simulator and the model reader can refer to the paper:

Pastorelli E, Capone C, Simula F, Sanchez-Vives MV, Del Giudice P, Mattia M and Paolucci PS (2019) Scaling of a Large-Scale Simulation of Synchronous Slow-Wave and Asynchronous Awake-Like Activity of a Cortical Model With Long-Range Interconnections. Front. Syst. Neurosci. 13:33. [doi: 10.3389/fnsys.2019.00033](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00033/full)

More in detail, the DPSNN simulator is described in section 2.1 (Material and Metods - **Description of the Distributed Simulator**), while the model is described in section 2.2 (Material and Metods - **Model Architecture and Network States**).
